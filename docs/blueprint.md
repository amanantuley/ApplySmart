## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#2E3192) to evoke professionalism and trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), subtly tinted towards blue, for a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and calls to action, providing a sense of innovation and efficiency.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear, readable content; Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for elegant headings; note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist icons for navigation and feature representation. Icons should be monochromatic in the primary color to maintain a clean aesthetic.
- Employ a sidebar navigation for key sections (Dashboard, Resume Builder, Cover Letter, SOP, Job Toolkit, ATS Score, Settings) with a content area for main interactions.
- Subtle transition animations for page navigation and element loading to improve user experience without being distracting.
